# Testing Java: JUnit 5, Mockito, Testcontainers, REST Assured


✅ **JUnit 5** 
✅ **Mockito** 
⏳ **Testcontainers** 
⏳ **REST Assured** 

---

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools Covered  
- **JUnit 5** – Unit testing in Java  
- **Mockito** – Mocking dependencies and verifying behavior  
- **Testcontainers** – Integration testing with real containerized services *(upcoming)*  
- **REST Assured** – API testing

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned 

### JUnit 5
- Writing unit tests with assertions (`assertEquals`, `assertThrows`, etc.)  
- Test lifecycle annotations (`@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach`, `@BeforeAll`, `@AfterAll`)  
- Parameterized tests for multiple inputs  

### Mockito
- Creating mock objects with `@Mock` and `Mockito.mock()`  
- Stubbing methods with `when(...).thenReturn(...)`  
- Throwing exceptions with `doThrow()`  
- Verifying interactions with `verify()`  
- Argument matchers like `any()` and `eq()`  
- Using `@InjectMocks` to inject dependencies into the tested class
